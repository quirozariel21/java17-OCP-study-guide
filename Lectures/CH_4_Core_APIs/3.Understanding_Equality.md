# Understanding Equality

## I. Comparing equals() and ==
Consider the following code that uses == with objects:
```java
var one = new StringBuilder();
var two = new StringBuilder();
var three = one.append("a");

System.out.println(one == two);         // false
System.out.println(one == three);       // true
```

Since this example isn't dealing with primitives, we know to look for whether the references are referring to the same object. The 
one adn two variables are both completely separate StringBuilder object, giving us two objects. Therefore, the first print statement 
gives us false. The three variable is more interesting. Remember how StringBuilder methods like to return the current reference 
for chaining. This means one and three both poit to the same object, and the second print statement gives us true. <br/>

&emsp;&emsp;
You saw earlier that equals() uses logical equality rather than object equality for String objects:
```java
var x = "Hello World";
var z = " Hello World".trim();
System.out.println(x.equals*(z));   // true
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Finally, the exam might try to trick you with a question like this. Can you guess why the code does not compile?
```java
var name = "Ariel";
var builder = new StringBuilder("Ariel");
System.out.println(name == builder);            // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Remember that == is checking for object reference equality. The compiler i smart enough to know that two references can't possibly 
point to the same object when they are completely different types.

## The String Pool
Since strings are everywhere in Java, they use up a lot of memory. in some production applications, they can use a large amount 
of memory in the entire program. Java realizes that many strings repeat in the program and solves this issue by reusing common ones. The 
string pool, also known as the intern pool, is a location in the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) that collects all these strings. <br/>

&emsp;&emsp;
The string pool contains literal values and constants that appear in your program. For example, "name" is a literal and therefore 
goes into the string pool. The `myObject.toString()` method returns a string but not a literal, so it does not go into the string pool. <br/>

&emsp;&emsp;
Let's now visit the more complex and confusing scenario, String equality, made so in part because of the way the JVM reuses String literals.
```java
var x = "Hello World";
var y = "Hello World";
System.out.println(x == y);     // true
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Remember that a String is immutable and literals are pooled. The JVM created only one literal in memory. The x and y variables both
point to the same location in memory; therefore, the statement outputs true. It gets ever trickier. Consider this code: 
```java
var x = "Hello World";
var z = " Hello World".trim();
System.out.println(x == z);     // false
```
&emsp;&emsp;
In this example, we don't have two of the same String literal. Although x and z happen to evaluate to the same string, one is 
computed at runtime. Since it isn't the same at compile-time, a new String object i created. Let's try another one. What do you 
think is output here?
```java
var singleString = "hello world";
var concat = "hello";
concat += "world";
System.out.println(singleString == concat);     // false
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This print false. Calling += is just like calling a method and results in a new String. You can even force the issue by creating 
a new String:
```java
var x = "Hello World";
var y = new String("Hello World");
System.out.println(x == y);         // false
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The former says to use the string pool normally. The second says, "No, JVM, I really don't want you to use the string pool. Please 
create a new object for me ven though it is less efficient." <br/>

&emsp;&emsp;
You can also do the opposite and tell Java to use the String pool. The `intern()` method will use an object in the string pool 
if one is present.
```java
public String intern()
```

&emsp;&emsp;
If the literal is not yet in the String pool, Java will add it at this time.
```java
var name = "Hello World";
var name2 = new String("Hello World").intern();
System.out.println(name == name2);              // true
```

&emsp;&emsp;
First we tell Java to use the string pool normally for `name`. Then, for `name2`, we tell Java to create a new object using the 
constructor but to intern it and use the string pool anyway. Since both variables point to the same reference in the string pool, 
we can use the == operator. <br/>

&emsp;&emsp;
Let's try another one. What do you think this prints out? Be careful. It is tricky.

```java
15: var first = "rat" + 1;
16: var second = "r" + "a" + "t" + "1";                     // compile time constant
17: var third = "r" + "a" + "t" + new String("1");
18: System.out.println(first == second);                    // true
19: System.out.println(first == second.intern());           // true
20: System.out.println(first == third);                     // false
21: System.out.println(first == third.intern());            // true
```
