# Using Method References
--------------------------
Method references are another way to make the code easier to read, such as simply mentioning the name of the method.
In this section, we are going to show you four types of method references. We also mix in lambdas with method 
references.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface LearToSpeak {
    void speak(String sound);
}
```

```java
public class DuckHelper {
    public static void teacher(String name, LearnToSpeack) {
        // Exercise patience (omitted)
        triner.speack(name);
    }
}
```

```java
public class Duckling {
    public static void makeSound(String sound) {
        LearToSpeak leaner = s -> System.out.println(s);
        DuckHelper.teacher(sound, learner);
    }
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Not bad. __There's a bit of redundancy__, though. A method reference lets us remove that redundancy and 
instead write this:
```java
LeartoSpeack learner = System.out::println;
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The :: operator tells Java to call the println() method later.

&emsp;&emsp;
There are four formats for method references:
- static methods
- Instance methods on a particular object
- Instance methods on a parameter to be dertermined at runtime
- Constructor

## I. Calling static Methods
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Converter {
    long round(double num);
}    
```
&emsp;&emsp;
We can implement this interface with the round() method in Math. Here we assign a method reference and a lambda to 
this functional interface.
```java
14: Converter methodRef = Math::round;
15: Converter lambda = x -> Math.round(x);
16:
17: System.out.println(methodRef.round(100.1)); // 100
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Wait a minute. You might be aware that the round() method is overloaded-it can take a double or float. How does Java 
know that we want to call the version with a double? With both lambdas and method references, Java infers information 
from the context. In this case, we said that we were declaring a Converter, which has a method taking a double 
parameter. Java looks for a method that matches that description. If it can't find multiple matches, then the 
compiler will report an error. The latter is sometimes called an ambiguous type error.

## II. Calling Instance Methods on a Particular Object
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface StringStart {
    boolean beginningCheck(String prefix);
}
```
```java
18: var str = "Zoo";
19: StringStart methodRef = str::startsWith;
20: StringStart lambda = s -> str.startsWith(s);
21:
22: System.out.println(methodRef.beginningCheck("A")); // false
```


&emsp;&emsp;
A method reference doesn't have to take any parameters. In this example, we can create a functional interface with 
a method that doesn't take any parameter but returns a value:
```java
interface StringChecker {
    boolean check();
}
```

```java
19: var str = "";
19: StringChecker methodRef = str::isEmpty;
20: StringChecker lambda = () -> str.isEmpty();
21:
22: System.out.println(methodRef.check()); // true
```

&emsp;&emsp;
While all method references can be turned into lambdas, the opposite is not always true. For example, consider this code:
```java
var str = "";
StringChecker lambda = () -> str.startWith("Zoo");
```

How might we write this as a method reference? You might try one of the following:
```java
StringChecker methodReference1 = str::startsWith;            // DOES NOT COMPILE
StringChecker methodReference2 = str::startsWith(""Zoo);     // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

Neither of these works! While we can pass the stsr as part of the method reference, there's no way to pass the "Zoo" 
parameters with it. Therefore, it if not possible to write this lambda as method reference.

## III. Calling Instance Methods on a Parameter

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface StringParameterChecker {
    boolean check(String text);
}
```

```java
23: StringParameterChecker methodRef = String::isEmpty;
24: StringParameterChecker lambda = s -> s.isEmpty();
25:
26: System.out.println(methodRef.check("Zoo")); // false
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Line 23 says the method that we want to call is declared in String. It looks like a static method, but it is not. 
Instead, Java knows that isEmpty() is an instance method that does not take any parameter. Java uses the parameter 
supplied at runtime as the instance on which the method is called.

## III. Calling Instance Methods on a Parameter

```java
interface StringTwoParameterChecker {
    boolean check(String text, String prefix);
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Pay attention to the parameter order when reading the implementation
```java
23: StringTwoParameterChecker methodRef = String::startsWith;
24: StringTwoParameterChecker lambda = (s, p) -> s.isEmpty(p);
25:
26: System.out.println(methodRef.check("Zoo", "A")); // false
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Remember that lines 23 may look like a static method, but it is really a method reference declaring that the instance 
of the object will be specified later. Line 24 shows some of the power of a method reference. We are able to 
replace two lambda parameters this time.

## IV. Calling Constructors
```java
interface EmptyStringCreator {
    String create();
}
```

```java
30: EmptyStringCreator methodRef = String::new;
31: EmptyStringCreator lambda = () -> new String();
32:
33: var myString = methodRef.create();
34: System.out.println(myString.equals("Snake"));   // false
```
&emsp;&emsp;
it expands like the method references you have seen so far. In the previous example, the lambda doesn't have ay 
parameters.
Method references can be tricky. This time we create a functional interface that takes one parameter and returns
a result:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface StringCopier {
    String copy(String value);
}
```

```java
32: StringCopier methodRef = String::new;
33: StringCopier lambda = x -> new String(x);
34:
35: var myString = methodRef.copy("Zebra");
36: System.out.println(myString.equals("Zebra")); // true
```

## V. Reviewing Method References
Reading method references is helpful in understanding the code. Table shows the four types of method references. if 
this table doesn't make sense, please reread the previous section. It can take a few tries before method references 
start to add up.
