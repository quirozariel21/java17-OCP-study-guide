# Using Concurrent Collections

The `java.util.concurrent` package provides several collections
- ConcurrentHashMap
- ConcurrentSkipListMap
- ConcurrentSkipListSet
- CopyOnWriteArraysList
- CopyOnWriteArraysSet

These are thread-safe and provide happens-before relationships from writes to reads.

Architectural benefits are relevant in heavily concurrent usage.
- the `Collections.synchronizedXxx` approach simply "serializes" every access.
  - which can result i ery poor scalability
  - but might be higher performance with low concurrency
