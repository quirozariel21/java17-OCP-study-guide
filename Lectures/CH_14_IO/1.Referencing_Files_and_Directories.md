# Referencing Files and Directories

In order to do anything useful, you first need an object that represents the path to a particular file or directory on the file system.
Using I/O, this is the **java.io.File** class, whereas with NIO.2, it is the **java.nio.file.Path** interface. The **File** class and 
**Path** interface cannot read or write data within a file, although they are passed as a reference to other classes.

```java
File file = new File("/home/tiger/data/stripes.txt");

Path path1 = Path.of("/home/tiger/data/stripes.txt");
Path path2 = Paths.get("/home/tiger/data/stripes.txt");
Path path3 = FileSystems.getDefault().get("/home/tiger/data/stripes.txt");
```
