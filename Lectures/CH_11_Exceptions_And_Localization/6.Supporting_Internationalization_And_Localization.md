#  Supporting Internationalization adn Localization
___Internationalization___ is the process of designing your program so it can be adapted. This involves placing strings 
in a properties file and ensuring that the proper data formatters are used. ___Localization___ means supporting multiple 
locales or geographic regions. You can think of a locale as being like a language and country pairing. Localization 
includes translating string to different languages. It aslo includes outputting dates and numbers in the correct 
format for that locale.
> __Note__
> Initially, your program does not need to support multiple locales. The key is to future-proof your application by 
> using these techniques. This way, when your product becomes successful, you can add support for new languages 
> without rewriting everything.

## I. Picking a Locale
The ___Locale___ class is in the ___java.util___ package. The first useful ___Locale___ to find is the user's current 
locale. Try running the following code on your computer.
```java
Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();
System.out.println(locale);
```
&emsp;&emsp;
When we run it, it prints `en_US`. It might be different for you. This default output tell us that our computers are 
using English and are siting in the United States.

&emsp;&emsp;
As practice, make sure that you understand why each of these Locale identifiers is valid.
```java
US          // Cannot have country without language
enUS        // Missing underscore 
US_en       // The country and language are reversed
EN          // Language must be lowercase
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The correct versions are ___en___ adn ___en_US___.
> ___Note___
> You do not need to memorize language or country codes. The exam will let you know about any that are being used. You 
> do need to recognize valid and invalid formats. Pay attention to uppercase/lowercase and the underscore. For example, 
> if you see a locale expressed as es_CO, then you should know that the language is es and the country CO, even if you 
> didn't know that they represent Spanish and Colombia, respectively.
>
&emsp;&emsp;
As a developer, you often need to write code that selects a locale other than the default one. There are three common 
ways of doing this. The first is to use the built-in constants in the Locale class, available for some common locales.
```java
System.out.println(Locale.GERMAN);      // de -> Language
System.out.println(Locale.GERMANY);     // de_DE -> language and country
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The second way of selecting a ___Locale___ is to use the constructor to create a new object. You can pass just a language, 
or both a language and country:
```java
System.out.println(new Locale("fr"));           // fr
System.out.println(new Locale("hi", "IN"));     // hi_IN
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Java will let you create a ___Locale___ with an invalid language or country, such as xx_XX. However, it will not match 
the ___Locale___ that you want to use, and your program will not behave as expected.
&emsp;&emsp;
There's a third way to create a Locale that is more flexible.
```java
Locale l1 = new Locale.Builder()
    .setLanguage("en")
    .setRegioin("US")
    .build();

Locale l2 = new Locale.Builder()
    .setRegioin("US")
    .setLanguage("en")
    .build();
```
&emsp;&emsp;
When testing a program, you might need to use a ___Locale___ other than your computer's default.
```java
System.out.println(Locale.getDefault());        // en_US
Locale locale = new Locale("fr");
Locale.setDefault(locale);
System.out.println(Locale.getDefault());        // fr
```
&emsp;&emsp;
TRy it, and don't worry--the ___Locale___ changes for only that one Java program. It does not change any setting on your 
computer. It does not even change future executions of the same program.
> ___Note___
> The exam may use `setDefault()` because it can't make assumptions about where you are localed. In practice, we rarely 
> write code to change a user's default locale.

## II. Localizing Numbers
The following sections cover how to format numbers, currency, and dates based on the locale.
&emsp;&emsp;
The first step to formatting or parsing data is the same: obtain an instance of a ___NumberFormat___. Table 11.8 shows 
the available factory methods.
&emsp;&emsp;
Once you have the **NumberFormat** instance, you can call `format()` to turn a number into a ___String___, or you can 
use `parse()` to turn a **String** into a number.

> ___Tip___
> The format classes are not thread-safe. Do not store them in **instance** variables or **static** variables. You 
> learn more about thread safety in Chapter 13, "Concurrency".

&emsp;&emsp;
### 1. Formatting Numbers
When we format data, we convert it from a structured object or primitive value into a String. The `NumberFormat.format()` 
method formats the given number based on the locale associated with the **NumberFormat** object.
```java
int attendeesPerYear = 3_200_000;
int attendeesPerMonth = attendeesPerYear / 12;

var us = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.US);
System.out.println()us.format(attendeesPerMonth);       // 266,666

var gr = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.GERMANY);
System.out.println(gr.format(attendeesPerMonth));       // 266.666

var ca = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.CANADA_FRENCH);
System.out.println(ca.format(attendeesPerMonth));       // 266 666
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Formatting currency works the same way.
```java
double price = 48;
var myLocale = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
System.out.println(myLocale.format(price));
```
&emsp;&emsp;
When run with the default locale of en_US for the United States, this code outputs $48.00. On the other hand, when run 
with the default locale of en_GB for Great britain, it outputs £48.00.

> **Note**
> In the ral world, use **int** or **BigDecimal** for money and not double. Doing math on amounts with double is 
> dangerous because the values are stored as floating-point numbers. Your boss won't appreciate it if you lose pennies 
> of fractions of pennies during transactions! 

&emsp;&emsp;
Finally, the exam may have examples that show formatting percentages:
```java
double successRate = 0.802;
var us = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(Locale.US);
System.out.println(us.format(successRate));     // 80%

var gr = NumberFormat.getPerecntInstance(Locale.GERMANY);
System.out.println(gr.format(successRate));     // 80 %
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Not much difference, we know, but you should at least be aware that the ability to print a percentage is locale-specific 
for the exam! <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;
### 2. Parsing Numbers
When we parse data, we convert it from a String to a structured object or primitive value. The `NUmberFormat.parse()` 
method accomplishes this and takes the locale into consideration.

> **Note**
> The `parse()` method, found in various types, declares a checked exception **ParseException** that must be handled 
> or declared in the method in which it is called.

&emsp;&emsp;
Let's look at an example. The following code parses a discounted ticket price with different locales. The `parse()` 
method throws a checked **ParseException**, so make sure to handle or declare it in your own code.
```java
String s = "40.45";
var en = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.US);
System.out.println(en.parse(s));            // 40.45

var fr = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.FRACE);
System.out.println(fr.parse(s));            // 4
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Inn the United States, a dot(.) is part of a number, and the number is parsed as you might expect. France does not use 
a decimal point to separate numbers. Java parses it as a formatting character, and it stops looking at the rest of the 
number. The lesson is to make sure that you parse using the right locale! <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;
The `parse()` method is also used for parsing currency. For example, we can read in the zoo's monthly income from 
ticket sales:
```java
String income = "$92,807.99";
var cf = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
double value = (Double) cf.parse(income);
System.out.println(value);      // 92807.99
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The currency String "$92,807.99" contains a dollar sign and a comma. The parse method strips out the characters and 
converts the value to a number. The return value of parse is a **Number** object. **Number** is the parent class of all 
the **java.lang** wrapper classes, so the return value can be cast to its appropriate data type. The **Number** is cast 
a **Double** and then automatically unboxed into a double. <br/>

### 3. Formatting with CompactNumberFormat
The class **CompactNumberFormat** is new to the Java 17. 
This class is similar to **DecimalFormat**, but it is a designed to be used in places where print space may be limted. It 
is opinionated in the sense that it picks a format for you, and locale-specific in that output can change depending on 
your location. 
```java
var formatters = Stream.of(
    NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstace(),
    NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstace(Locale.getdefault, Style.SHORT),
    NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstace(Locale.getDefault(), Style.LONG),
    NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstace(Locale.GERMAN, Style.SHORT),
    NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstace(Locale.GERMAN, Style.LONG),
    NumberFormat.getNumberInstance()
    );
formatters.map(s -< s.format(7_123_456)).forEach(System.out::println);
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The following is printed by this code when run in the en_US locale (line breaks added for readability):
```java
7M
7M
7 million

7 Mio.
7 Millionen

7,123,456
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Another example:
```java
formatters.map(s -> s.format(314_900_000)).forEach(System.out::println);
```
```java
315M
315M
315 million

315 Mio.
315 Millionen

314,900,000
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Notice that the third digit is automatically rounded up for the entries that use a **CompactNumberFormat**. The following 
summarized the rules for **CompactNumberFormat**:
- First it determines the highest range for the number, such as thousand (k), million (M), billion (B), or trillion (T).
- It then returns up to the first three digits of that range, rounding the last digit as needed.
- Finally, it prints an identifier. If **SHORT** is used, a symbol is returned. If **LONG** is used, a space followed by 
a word is returned. <br/>

## III. Localizing Dates
Like numbers, date formats can vary by locale. Table 11.9 shows methods used to retrieve an instance of a 
**DateTimeFormatter** using the default locale.

> **Table 11.9** Factory methods to get a **DateTimeFormatter**
>
> | Description                     | Using **default Locale**                                                                                                                                 |
> |:--------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | For formatting dates            | DateTieFormatter.ofLocalizedDate(FormatStyle dateStyle)                                                                                                  |
> | For formatting times            | DateTieFormatter.ofLocalizedTime(FormatStyle timeStyle)                                                                                                  |
> | For formatting dates  and times | DateTieFormatter.ofLocalizedDateTime(FormatStyle dateStyle, FormatStyle timeStyle) <br/> DateTieFormatter.ofLocalizedDateTime(FormatStyle dateTimeStyle) |

&emsp;&emsp;
What if you need a formatter for a specific locale? Easy enough--just append `withLocale(locale)` to the method call.
&emsp;&emsp;
Let’s put it all together. Take a look at the following code snippet, which relies on a static import for the 
**java.time.format.FormatStyle.SHORT** value:
```java
public static void print(DateTimeFormatter dtf, LocalDateTime dateTime, Locale locale) {
    System.out.println(dtf.format(dateTime) + " --- " + dtf.withLocale(locale).format(dateTime));    
}

public static void main(String... args) {
    Locale.setdefault(new Locale("en", "US"));
    var italy = new Locale("it", "IT");
    var dt = LocalDateTime.of(2022, Month.OCTOBER, 20, 15, 12, 34);
    
    // 10/20/22 --- 20/10/22
    print(DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDate(SHORT), dt, italy);

    // 3:12 PM --- 15:12
    print(DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedTime(SHORT), dt, italy);

    // 10/20/22, 3:12 PM --- 20/10/22, 15:12
    print(DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDateTime(SHORT, SHORT), dt, italy);
}

```

## IV. Specifying a Locale Category
When you call `Locale.setDefault()` with a locale, several display and formatting options are internally selected. If 
you require finer-grained control of the default locale, Java subdivides the underlying formatting options into 
distinct categories with **Locale.Category** enum.
&emsp;&emsp;
The **Locale.Category** enum is a nested element in Locale that supports distinct locales for displaying and formatting 
date. For the exam, you should be familiar with the two enum values in Table 11.10.

> **Table 11.10** Locale.Category values
>
> | Value     | Description                                                |
> |:----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
> | DISPLAY   | Category used for displaying data about locale             |
> | FORMAT    | Category used for formatting dates, numbers, or currencies |

&emsp;&emsp;
When you call `Locale.setDefault()` with a locale, the **DISPLAY88 and **FORMAT** are set together. Let's take a look at 
an example:
```java
10: public static void printCurrency(Locale locale, double money) {
11:     System.out.println(
12:         NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance().format(money)
13:         + ", " + locale.getDisplayLanguage());
14: }
15: public static void main(String[] args) {
16:     var spain = new Locale("es", "ES");
17:     var money = 1.23;
18:
19:     // Print with default locale
20:     Locale.setDefault(new Locale("en", "US"));
21:     printCurrency(spain, money); // $1.23, Spanish
22:
23:     // Print with selected locale display
24:     Locale.setDefault(Category.DISPLAY, spain);
25:     printCurrency(spain, money); // $1.23, español
26:
27:     // Print with selected locale format
28:     Locale.setDefault(Category.FORMAT, spain);
29:     printCurrency(spain, money); // 1,23 €, español
30: }
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The code prints the same data three times. First it prints the language of the spain and money variables using the locale 
**en_US**. Then it prints it using the **DISPLAY** category of **es_ES**, while the **FORMAT** category remains **en_US**. 
finally, it prints the data using both categories set to **es_ES**. <br/><br/>
&emsp;&emsp;
You just to know that you can set parts of the locale independently. You should also know that calling `Locale.setDefault(us)` 
after the previous code sippet will change both locale categories to **en_US**.
