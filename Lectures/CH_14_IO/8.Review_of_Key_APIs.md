# Review of Key APIs
The key APIs that you need to know for the exam are listed in Table 14.14. We know some of the classes look similar. You need to know
this table really well before taking the exam.

| Class        | Purpose                                          | 
|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| File         | I/O representation of location in file system.   |
| Files        | Helper methods for working with Path.            |
| Path         | NIO.2 representation of location in file system. |
| Paths        | Contains factory methods to get Path.            |
| URI          | Uniform resource identifier for files, URL, etc. |
| FileSystem   | NIO.2 representation of file system.             |
| FilesSystems | Contains factory methods to get FileSystem.      |
| InputStream  | Superclass for reading files based on bytes.     |
| OutputStream | Superclass for writing files based on bytes.     |
| Reader       | Superclass of reading files based on characters. | 
| Writer       | Superclass of writing files based on characters. |

Additionally, Figure 14.8 shows all of the I/O stream classes that you should be familiar with for the exam, with the exception of the 
filter streams. *FilterInputStream* and *FilterOutputStream* are high-level superclasses that filter or transform data. They are rarely 
used directly.

The **InputStreamReader** and **OutputStreamWriter** are incredible convenient and are also unique in that they are the only I/O stream 
classes to have both **InputStream/OutputStream** and **Reader/Writer** in their name.
