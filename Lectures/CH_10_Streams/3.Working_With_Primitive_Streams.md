# Working with Primitive Streams
-------------------------------
Up until now, all of the streams we've created used the Stream interface with a generic type, like `Stream<String>`, 
`Stream<Integer>`, and so on. For numeric values, we have been using wrapper classes. We did this with Collection API 
in Chapter 9, so it should feel natural.

&emsp;&emsp;
Java actually includes other stream classes besides Stream that you can use to work with select primitives: int, double, 
and long. Letâ€™s take a look at why this is needed. Suppose that we want to calculate the sum of numbers in a finite 
stream:
```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3);
System.out.println(stream.reduce(0, (n, s) -> n + s));      //6
```

&emsp;&emsp;
There is another way of doing that, shown here:
```java
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3);
System.out.println(stream.mapToInt(x -> x).sum());          //6
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This time, we converted our `Stream<Integer>` to an `IntStream` and asked the `IntStream` to calculate the sum for us. 
An IntStream has many of the same intermediate and terminal methods as a Stream but __includes specialized methods for 
working with numeric data__. The primitive streams know how to perform certain common operations automatically.

&emsp;&emsp;
So far, this seems like a nice convenience but not terribly important. Now think about how you would compute an average. 
You need to divide the sum by the number of elements. The problem is that streams allow only one pass. Java recognizes 
that calculating an average is a common thing to do, and it provides a method to calculate the average on the stream 
classes for primitives.
```java
IntStream intStream = IntStream.of(1, 2, 3);
OptionalDouble avg = intStream.average();
System.out.println(avg.getAsDouble());
```
## I. Creating Primitive Streams
Here are the three types of primitive streams:
- __IntStream:__ Used for the primitive types int, short, byte and char.
- __LongStream:__ Used for the primitive type long.
- __DoubleStream:__ Used for the primitive types float and double.

> __Tip:__
> When you see the word stream on the exam, pay attention to the case. With a capital S or in code, Stream is the name 
> of a class that contains an Object type. With a lowercase s, a stream is a concept that might be a Stream, 
> DoubleStream, IntStream, or LongStream.

Table 10.5 shows some of the methods that are unique to primitive streams. Notice that we don't include methods in the 
table like `empty()` that you already know from the Stream interface.

Some of the methods for creating a primitive stream are equivalent to how we created the source for a regular Stream. 
You can create an empty stream with this:
```java
DoubleStream empty = DoubleStraem.empty();
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Another way is to use the `of()` factory method from a single value or by using the varargs overload.
```java
DoubleStream oneValue = DoubleStream.of(3.14);
oneValue.forEach(System.out::println);

DoubleStream varargs = DoubleStream.of(1.0, 1.1, 1.2);
varargs.forEach(System.out::println);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
This code outputs the following
```java
3.14
1.0
1.1
1.2
```

&emsp;&emsp;
You can also use two methods for creating infinite streams, just like we did with Stream.
```java
var random = DoubleStrea.generate(Math::random);
var fractions = DoubleStream.ieerate(.5, d -> d / 2);
random.limit(3).forEach(System.out::println);
fractions.limit(3).forEach(System.out::println);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Since the streams are infinite, we added a limit intermediate operation so that the output doesn't print values forever. 
The first stream calls a static method on Math to get a random double. Since the numbers are random, your output will 
obviously be different. The second stream keeps creating smaller numbers, dividing the previous value by two each time. 
The output from when we ran this code was as follows:
```java
0.07890654781186413
0.28564363465842346
0.6311403511266134
0.5
0.25
0.125
```

## II. Mapping Streams
Another way to create a primitive stream is by mapping from another stream type. Table 10.6 shows that there is a method 
for mapping between any stream types.
> __Table 10.6__: Mapping methods between types of streams

| Source stream class | To create Stream | To create DoubleStream | ToCreateIntStream | To create LongStream |
|:--------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------|:------------------|:---------------------|
| Stream              | map()            | mapToDouble()          | mapToInt()        | mapToLong()          |
| DoubleStream        | maptoObj()       | map()                  | maptToInt()       | mapToLong()          |
| IntStream           | mapToObj()       | mapToDouble()          | map()             | mapToLong()          |
| LongStream          | mapToObj()       | mapToDouble()          | mapToInt()        | map()                |

&emsp;&emsp;
Obviously, hey have to be compatible types for this to work. Java requires a mapping function to be provided as a 
parameter, for example:
```java
Stream<String> objStream = Stream.of("dog", "fish");
IntStream intStream = objStream.mapToInt(s -> s.length());
```
> __Using flatMap()__
> We can use this approach on primitive streams as well. It works the same way as on a regular Stream, except the method 
> name is different. Here's an example:
> ```java
> var integerList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
> IntStream ints = integerList.stream()
>                              .flatMapToInt(x -> IntStream.of(x));
> DoubleStream doubles = integerList.stream()
>                                   .flatMapToDouble(x -> DoubleStream.of(x));
> LongStream longs = integerList.stream()
>                                   .flatMapToLong(x -> LongStream.of(x));
> ```

> __Table 10.7__: Function parameters when mapping between types of streams
 
| Source stream class | To CreateStream | To create DoubleStream | To create IntStream | To create LongStream |
|:--------------------|:----------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------|:---------------------|
| Stream              | Function<T, R>  | ToDouble Function      | ToInt Function      | ToLong Function      |
| DoubleStream        | DoubleFunction  | DoubleUnaryOpeartor    | DoubleToIntFunction | DoubleToLongFunction |
| IntStream           | IntFunction     | IntToDoubleFunction    | IntUnaryOpeartor    | IntToLongFunction    |
| LongStream | LongFunctoin | LongToDoubleFunction | LongToIntFunction | LongUnaryOpetator    |

&emsp;&emsp;
Additionally, you can create a Stream from a primitive stream. These methods show ways of accomplishing 
this:
```java
private static Stream<Integer> mapping(IntStream stream) {
    return stream.mapToObj(x -> x);    
}

private static Stream<Integer> boxing(IntStream stream) {
    return stream.boxed();    
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The first one uses the `mapToObk()` method we saw earlier. The second one is more succinct. It does not 
require a mapping function because all it does autobox each primitive to the corresponding wrapper object. 
The `boxed()` method exists on all three types of primitive streams.

 ## III. Using Optional with Primitive Streams
Why not just use `Optional<Double>`? The difference is that OptionalDouble is for a primitive and 
Optional is for Double wrapper class. Working with the primitive optional class looks similar to 
working with the Optional class itself.
```java
var stream = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 10);
OptionalDouble optional = stream.average();

optional.ifPresent(System.out:print);                       // 5.5
System.out.println(optional.getAsDouble);                   // 5.5
System.out.println(optional.orElseGet(() - Double.Nana));   // 5.5
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The only noticeable difference is that we called `getAsDouble()` rather than `get()`. This makes it clear that we are 
working with a primitive. Also, `orElseGet()` takes a DoubleSupplier instead of a Supplier.
