# Using common Collections APIs
-------------
A collection is a group of objects contained in a single object. The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes in
`java.util` for storing collections. There are four main interfaces in the Java Collection Framework.
* **List**
   A List is an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate entries.
   Elements in a List can be accessed by an int index.
* **Set**
  A set is a collection that does not allow duplicate entries.
* **Queue**
  Since ___Queue___ is a FIFO structure (First In First Out i.e., add to the end and remove from the front, it provides
  methods `push(e)` and `pop()` for this purpose, where push adds to the front and pop movies from the front.

  ___Stack___ is a LIFO structure (Last In First Out i.e. add to the front and remove from the front).
* **Map**
  A map is a collection that maps keys to values, with no duplicate keys allowed. The elements in a map are key/value pairs.
