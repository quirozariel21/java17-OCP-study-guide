# 2.Coding Functional Interfaces
--------------------------------
A functional interface is an interface that contains a single abstract method.

## Defining a Functional Interface

```java

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Sprint {
    void sprint(int speed);
}

public class Tiger implements Sprint {
    @Override
    public void sprint(int speed) {
        System.out.println("Animal is sprinting fast! " + speed);   
    }
}
```

> __The @FunctionalInterface Annotation__ tells the compiler that you intend for the code to be a functional interface.
> if the interface does not follow the rules for a functional interface, the compiler will give you an error.
> ```java
> @FunctionalInterface
> public interface Dance  { // DOES NOT COMPILE
>   void move();
>   void rest();
> }
> ```

&emsp;&emsp;
Consider the following four interfaces, which of the following a re functional interfaces?
```java
public interface Dash extends Sprint { }            // YES IS FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE

public interface Skip extends Sprint {              // NO FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
    void skip();                // Two abstract methods
}

public interface Sleep {                            // NO FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
    private void snore() {}                         // No abstract methods
    default int getZzz() { return 1; }
}

public interface Climb {                            // YES IS FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
    void reach();           // one abstract method
    default void fall() { }
    static int getBackup() { return 100; }
    private static boolean checkHeight() { return true; }
}
```

## II. Adding Object Methods
All classes inherit certain methods from Object. For the exam, you should know the following Object method signatures:
- public String toString()
- public boolean equals(Object)
- public int hashCode()
> __Note:__
> Since Java assumes all classes extend from Object, you also cannot declare an interface method that is incompatible 
> with Object. For example, declaring an abstract method int toString() in an interface would not compile since 
> Object's version of the method returns a String.

&emsp;&emsp;
Let's take a look at an example. Is this class a functional interface?
```java
public interface Soar {
    abstract String toString();
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
It is not. Since toString() is a public method implemented in Object, it does not count toward the single abstract 
method test. On the other hand, the following implementation of Dive is a functional interface:
```java
public interface Dive {
    Strig toString();
    public boolean equals(Object o);
    public abstract int hashCode();
    public void dive();
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The dive() method is the single abstract method, while the others are not counted since they are public methods 
defined in the Object class.
&emsp;&emsp;
Another Example, is it a functional interface?
```java
public class Hibernate {
    String toString();
    public boolean equals(Hibernate h);
    public abstract int hashCode();
    public void rest();
}
```
Despite that it is similar to Dive interface, Hibernate interface uses equals(Hibernate) instead equals(Object). 
Because this code not match the method signature of the equals(Object) method defined in the Object class, this 
interface is counted as containing two abstract methods: equals(Hibernate) and rest().
