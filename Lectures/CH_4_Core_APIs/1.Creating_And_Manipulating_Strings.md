# Creating and ManipulatingStrings
Create a String:
```java
String name = "Fluffy";
String name = new String("Fluffy");
```
&emsp;&emsp;
String class is special and doesn't need to be instantiated with _new_.

&emsp;&emsp;
Further, text blocks are another way of creating a String. To review, this text block is the same as the previous variables:
```java
String name = """
              Fluffy""";
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Since a String is a sequence of characters, you probably won't be surprised to hear that if implements the interface 
`CharSequecence`. This interface is a general way of representing several classes, including `String` and `StringBuilder`.
