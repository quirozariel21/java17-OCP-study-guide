# Sorting Data

## Comparable Interface
Java Comparable interface is used to order the objects of the user-defined class. This interface contains only 
one method named __compareTo(Object)__. It provides a single sorting sequence only, i.e., you can __sort__ the 
elements on the bases of a __single data member__ only. For example, it mat be rollno, name. age or anything else.

> public int compareTo(Object)
> *Positive integer (+), if the current object is greater than the specific object.
> *Negative integer (-), if the current object is less than the specified object.
> *Zero, if the current object is equal to the specified object.

__Collections__ class provides static methods for sorting the elements of collections.

Remember if the field id is int, the __id -a.id sorts in ascending__ order, and __a.id - id sorts in 
descending__ order.

> Using Collections.sort() and sorted by age ASC
> ```java
> import java.util.ArrayList;
> import java.util.Collections;
> import java.util.List;
>
> class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
>   int rollno;
>   String name;
>   int age;
>   //Constructor
> 
>   @Override
>   public String compareTo(Student student) {
>       return this.age - student.age;            // ASC
>   }
> 
> }
> 
> public class Main {
>  public static void main(String... args) {
>       List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
>       student.add(new Student(1, "Ariel", 36));
>       student.add(new Student(5, "Alina", 42));
>       student.add(new Student(8, "Ximena", 40));
>       student.add(new Student(2, "Gael", 3));
> 
>       Collections.sort(students);
>       students.forEach(student -> System.out.println(student));
>  }
> }
> ```
> Output:
> Student{rollno=2, name='Gael', age=3}
>Student{rollno=1, name='Ariel', age=36}
>Student{rollno=8, name='Ximena', age=40}
>Student{rollno=5, name='Alina', age=42}

## Comparator Interface

Sometimes you want to sort an object that did not implement Comparable, or you want to sort objects
in different ways at different times.

> ```java
> public interface Comparator<T> {
>   public int compare(T o1, T o2);
> }
> ```
> Negative value means that first object was smaller than second object.
> The value 0 means the two objects are equal.
> Positive value means that the first object was larger than second object.

Comparator is a functional interface since there is only one abstract method to implement.
```java
Comparator<Duck> byWeight = (d1, d2) -> d1,getWeight() - d2.getWeight();
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Alternative, we can use a method reference and helper method to specify that we want to sort by weight.
```java
Comparator<Duck> byWeight = Comparator.comparing(Duck::getWeight);
```

### Comparison of Comparable and Comparator

| Difference                                        | Comparable  | Comparator  |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Package name                                      |  java.lang  |  java.util  |
| Interface must be implemented by class comparing? |     YES     |     NO      |
| Method name in interface                          | compareTo() |  compare()  |
| Number of parameters                              |      1      |      2      |
| Common to declare using lambda                    |     NO      |     YES     |

### Comparing multiple fields
```java
public class Squirrel {
    private int weight;
    private String species;
    // Assume getter/setters/constructors
}
```

```java
public class MultiFieldComparator implements Comparator<Squirrel> {
    
    @Override
    public int compare(Squirrel s1, Squirrel s2) {
        int result = s1.getSpecies().compareTo(s2.getSpecies());
        if(result != 0) return result;
        return s1.getWeigth() - s2.getWeigth();
    }
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Alternative, we can use method references and build the Comparator. This code represents logic for the same comparison.

```java
Comparator<Squirrel> c = Comparator.comparing(Squirrel::getSpecies).thenComparingInt(Squirrel::getWeight);
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Suppose we want to sort in descending order by species
```java
Comparator<Squirrel> c = Comparator.comparing(Squirrel::getSpecies).reversed();
```

### Helper default methods for building a Comparator

| Method                  |                                                         Description                                                         |
|-------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| reversed()              |                                              Reverse the order of the chained                                               |
| thenComparing(function) |          If the previous Comparator return 0, the comparator that returns an Object or can be autoboxed into one.           |
| thenComparingDouble()   | If the previous Comparator return 0, thi comparator that returns a double. Otherwise, return from the previous Comparator.  |
| thenComparingInt()      |   If the previous Comparator return 0, thi comparator that returns a int. Otherwise, return from the previous Comparator.   |
| thenComparingLong()     |   If the previous Comparator return 0, thi comparator that returns a log. Otherwise, return from the previous Comparator.   |

## Sorting and Searching

Now that you have learned all about Comparable and Comparator, we can finally do something useful with them, like 
sorting. The Collections.sort() method uses the compareTo() method to sort. It expects the objects to be sorted to 
be Comparable.

```java
public class SortRabbits {
    static record Rabbit(int id) {}
    
    public static void main (String... args) {
        List<Rabbit> rabbits = new ArrayList<>();
        rabbits.add(new Rabbit(3));
        rabbits.add(new Rabbit(1));
        Collections.sort(rabbits);      // DOES NOT COMPILE
    }
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Java knows that Rabbit record is not Comparable. It knows sorting will fail, so it does not even let the code compile. 
You can fix this by passing a Comparator to sort. Remember that a Comparator is useful when you want to specify sort 
order without using a compareTo() method.

```java
8: Comparator<Rabbit> c = (r1, r2) -> r1.id - r2.id;
9: Collections.sort(rabbits, c);
```
