# Working With Dates And Times
```java
import java.time.*;     // import time classes
```

## I. Creating Dates and Times

** - LocalDate: ** Contains just a date-- no time and not time zone. <br/>
** - LocalTime: ** Contains just a time-- no date and no time zone. <br/>
** - LocalDateTime: ** Contains both a date and time but no time zone. <br/>
** - ZonedDateTime: ** Contains a date, time and time zone. <br/>


```java
System.out.println(LocalDate.now());
System.out.println(LocalTime.now());
System.out.println(LocalDateTime.now());
System.out.println(ZonedDateTime.now());
```
```java
2021-10-25
09:13:07.768 
2021-10-25T09:13:07.768
2021-10-25T09:13:07.768[America/New_York]
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The key is the type of information in the output. The first line contains only a date and no time. The second contains only a time 
adn no date. The time displays hours, minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds. The third contains both a date and a time. The
output uses T to separate the date and time when converting `LocalDateTime` to `String`. Finally, the fourth adds the time zone offset 
and time zone. New York is four time zones away from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;
*Greenwich Mean Time* is a time zone in Europe that is used as time zone zero when discussing offsets. You might have also heard 
of Coordinated Universal Time, which i a tim zone standard. It is abbreviated as UTC, as compromise between the English and French 
names. (That's not a type. UTC isn't actually the proper acronym in either language!) UTC uses the same time zone zero as GMC.

> **Time Zone Rules**
> The time zone offset can be listed in different ways: +02:00. GMT+2, and UTC+2 all mean the same thing. You might see any 
> of them on the exam.

```java
public static LocalDate of(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth)
public static LocalDate of(int year, Month month, int dayOfMonth)
```
> **Note**
> Up to now, we've been continually telling you thatJava counts starting with 0. Well, months are an exception. For months in
> the new date and time methods, Java counts starting from 1, just as we humans do.

```java
public static LocalTime of(int hour, int minute)
public static LocalTime of(int hour, int minute, int second)
public static LocalTime of(int hour, int minute, int second, int nanos)
```

```java
public static LocalDateTime(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minutes)
public static LocalDateTime(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minutes, int seconds)
public static LocalDateTime(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minutes, int seconds, int nanos)
```

```java
public static LocalDateTime(int year, Month month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minutes)
public static LocalDateTime(int year, Month month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minutes, int seconds)
public static LocalDateTime(int year, Month month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minutes, int seconds, int nanos)
```

```java
public static LocalDateTime of(LocalDate date, LocalTime time)
```

```java
public static ZonedDateTime of(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hout, int second, int nanos, ZoneId zone)
public static ZonedDateTime of(LocalDate date, LocalTime time, ZoneId Zone)
public static ZonedDateTime of(LocalDateTime dateTime, ZoneId zone)
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Notice that there isn't an option to pass in the Month enum. Also, we did not use a constructor in any of the examples. The date 
and time classes have private constructors along with static methods that return instances. This is known as the factory pattern.

## II. Manipulating Dates and Times

| plusWeeks() <br/> minusWeeks()     | Yes                    | No                     | Yes                                         |

| plusMinutes() <br/> minusMinutes() | No                     | Yes                    | Yes                                         |
| plusSeconds() <br/> minusSeconds() | No                     | Yes                    | Yes                                         |
| plusNanos() <br/> minusNanos()     | No                     | Yes                    | Yes                                         | 

## III. Working with Periods
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    var start = LocalDate.of(2022, Month.JANUARY, 1);
    var end = LocalDate.of(2022, Month.MARCH, 30);
    var period = Period.ofMonths(1);                    // Create a period
}

public static void performAnimalEnrichment(LocalDate start, LocalDate end, Period period) {
    var upTo = start;
    while (upTo.isBefore(end)) {
        System.out.println("give new toy: " + upTo);
        upTo = upTo.plus(period);
    }
}
```

```java
var annually = Period.ofYears(1);           // every 1 year
var quaterly = Period.ofMonth(3);           // every 3 months
var everyThreeWeeks = Period.ofWeeks(3);    // every 3 weeks
var everyOtherDay = Period.ofDays(2);       // every 2 days
var everyYearAndAWeek = Period.of(1, 0, 7)   // every year and 7 days
```

&emsp;&emsp;
There's one catch. You cannot chain methods when creating a Period. The following code looks like it is equivalent to the 
everyYearAndAWeek example, but it's not. Only the last methods is used because the Period of methods are static methods.
```java
var wrong = Period.ofYears(1).ofWeeks(1);       // every week
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This tricky code is really writing the following:
```java
var wrong = Period.ofYeasr(1);
wrong = Priod.ofWeeks(1);
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This is clearly not what you intended! That's why the `of()` method allows you to pass in the number of years, months, and years. They 
are all included in the same period. You will get a compiler warning about this. Compiler warning tell you that is wrong or 
suspicious without failing compilation. <br/>

&emsp;&emsp;
The `of()` method takes only years, months, and days. The ability to use another factory method to pass weeks is merely a 
convenience. As you might imagine, the actual period is stored in terms of years, months, and days. When you print out the value, 
Java displays any non-zero parts using the format shown below:
```java
System.out.println(Period.of(1, 2, 3));

// output: P1Y2M3D
// P is for period
// 1Y i 1 year
// 2M is 2 months
// 3D is 3 days
```
&emsp;&emsp;
As you can see, the P always starts out the String to show it is a period measure. Then come the number of years, number of months, 
and number of days. If any of these are zero, they are omitted.
```java
System.out.println(Priod.ofMonths(3));
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The output is `3M`. Remember that Java omits any measures that are zero. The las thing to know about Period is what objects it can 
be used with. Let's look at some code:
```java
3: var date = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 20);
4: var time = LocalTime.of(6, 15);
5: var dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(date, time);
6: var period = Period.ofMonths(1);
7: System.out.println(date.plus(period));           // 2022-02-20
8: System.out.println(dateTime.plus(period));       // 2022-02-20T06:15
9: System.out.println(time.plus(period));           // Exception -> UnsupportedTemporalTypeException
```

## IV. Working with Durations
Duration, which is intended for smaller units of time. For Duration, you can specify the number of days, hours, minutes, seconds, 
or nanoseconds. And yes, you could pass 365 days to make a year but you really shouldn't--that's what Period is for. <br/> 
```java
var daily = Duration.ofDays(1);                     // PT24H
var hourly = Duration.ofHours(1);                   // PT1H
var everyMinute = Duration.ofMinutes(1);            // PT1M
var everyTenSeconds = Duration.ofSeconds(10);       // PT10S
var everyMill = Duration.ofMillis(1);               // PT0.001S
var everyNano = Duration.ofNanos(1);                // PT0.00000001S
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Duration includes another more generic factory method/ It takes a umber and a TemporalUnit. The idea is, say, something like 
"5 seconds." However, TemporalUnit is an interface. At the moment, thereis only one implementation named ChronoUnit. <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;
The previous example could be rewritten like this:
```java
var daily = Duration.of(1, ChrononUnits.DAYS);
var hourly = Duration.of(1, ChrononUnits.HOURS);
var everyMinute = Duration.of(1, ChrononUnits.MINUTES);
var everyTenSeconds = Duration.of(10, ChrononUnits.SECONDS);
var everyMill = Duration.of(1, ChrononUnits.MILLIS);
var everyNano = Duration.of(1, ChrononUnits.NANOS);
```
&emsp;&emsp;
ChronoUnit also includes some convenient units such as ChronoUnit.HALF_DAYS to represent 12 hours.

> **ChronoUnit for Differences**
> ChronoUnit is a great way to determine how far apart two Temporal values are. Temporal includes LocalDate, LocalTime, and so 
> on. ChronoUnit is in the java.time.temporal package.
> ```java
> var one = LocalTime.of(5, 15);
> var two = LocalTime.of(6, 30);
> var date = LocalDate.of(2016, 1, 20);
> System.out.println(ChronoUnit.HOURS.betweeen(one, two));          // 1
> System.out.println(ChronoUnit.MINUTES.between(one, two));         // 75
> System.out.println(ChronoUnit.MINUTES.between(one, date));        // DateTimeException
> ```
> Alternatively, you can truncate any object with a time element. For example:
> ```java
> LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(3, 12, 45);
> System.out.println(time);                     // 03:12:45
> LocalTime truncated = time.truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.MINUTES);
> System.out.println(truncated);                // 03:12
> ```
> This example zeroes out any fields smaller than minutes. In our case, it gets rid of the seconds.

&emsp;&emsp;
Using a Duration works the same way as using a Period. For example:
```java
var date = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 20);
var time = LocalTime.of(6, 15);
var dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(date, time);
var duration = Duration.ofHours(6);
System.out.println(dateTime.plus(duration));            // 2022-01-20T12:15
System.out.println(time.plus(duration));                // 12:15
System.out.println(date.plus(duration));                // UnsupportedTemporalTypeException
```

```java
var date = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 20);
var time = LocalTime.of(6, 15);
var dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(date, time);
var duration = Duration.ofHours(23);

System.out.println(datTime.plus(duration));         // 2022-01-21T05:15
System.out.println(time.plus(duration));            // 05:15
System.out.println(date.plus(duration));            // UnsupportedTemporalTypeException
```

## V. Period vs. Duration
Remember that Period and Duration are not equivalent. This example shows a Period and Duration of the same length:
```java
var date = LocalDate.of(2022, 5, 25);
var period = Period.ofDay(1);
var days = Duration.ofDays(1);

System.out.println(date.plus(period));          // 2022-05-26
System.out.println(date.plus(days));            // Unsupported unit: Seconds
```

- Table: Where to use Duration and Period

|               | Can use with Period? | Can use with Duration? |
|---------------|:---------------------|:-----------------------|
| LocalDate     | Yes                  | No                     |
| LocalTime     | No                   | Yes                    |
| LocalDateTime | Yes                  | Yes                    |
| ZonedDateTime | Yes                  | Yes                    |

## VI. Working with Instants
