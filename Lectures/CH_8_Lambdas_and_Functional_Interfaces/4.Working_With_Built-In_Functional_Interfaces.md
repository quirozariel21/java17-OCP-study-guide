# Working With Built-In Functional Interfaces
---------------------------------------------
The core functional interfaces in Table 8.4 are provided in the java.util.function package.
> __Table 8.4:__ Core Functional interfaces

| Functional interface | Return type | Method name  | # of parameters |
|:---------------------|:-----------:|:-------------|:----------------|
| Supplier             |      T      | get()        | 0               |
| Consumer             |    void     | accept(T)    | 1(T)            |
| BiConsumer<T, U>     |    void     | accept(T, U) | 2(T, U)         |
| Predicate            |   boolean   | test(T)      | 1(T)            |
| BiPredicate<T, U>    |   boolean   | test(T, U)   | 2(T, U)         |
| Function<T, R>       |     R       | apply(T)     | 1(T)            |
| BiFunction<T, U, R>  |      R      | apply(T, U)  | 2(T, U)         |
| UnaryOperator        |      T      | apply(T)     | 1(T)            |
| binaryOperator       |      T      | apply(T, T)  | 2(T, T)         |

For the exam, you need to memorize Table 8.4. We will give you lots of practice in this section to help make it 
memorable. Before you ask, most of the time we don't assign the implementation of the interface to a variable. The 
interface name is implied, and it i passed directly to the method that needs it. We are introducing the names so 
that you can better understand and remember what is going on.
> __Note:__
> You learn about a few more functional interfaces later in the book. In the next chapter, we cover Comparator. 
> In Chapter 13, "Concurrency", we discuss Runnable and Callable. These may show up on the exam when you are asked 
> to recognize functional interfaces.

## I. Implementing Supplier
A supplier is used when you want to generate or supply values without taking any input. The Supplier interface is 
defined as follows:
```java
public interface Supplier<T> {
    T get();
}
```

```java
Supplier<LocalDate> s1 = LocalDate::now;
Supplier<LocalDate> s2 = () -> LocalDate.now();

LocalDate d1 = s1.get();
LocalDate d2 = s2.get();

System.out.println(d1);  //2024-05-31
System.out.println(d2);  //2024-05-31
```
