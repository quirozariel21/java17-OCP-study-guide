# Introducing IO Streams
Table 14.7 list the abstract base classes that all I/O streams from.

| Class name    | Description                                     |
|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| InputStream   | Abstract class for all input byte streams.      | 
| OutputStream  | Abstract class for all output byte streams.     |
| Reader        | Abstract class for all input character streams  |
| Writer        | Abstract class for all output character streams |

Table 14.8 list the concrete I/O streams that you should be familiar with for the exam. Note that most of the information about each
I/O stream, such as whether it is an input or output stream or whether it accesses data using bytes or characters, can be decoded by 
the name alone.
