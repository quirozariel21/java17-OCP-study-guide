# Introducing Threads
***Thread*** <br/>
A Thread is the smallest unit execution that can be scheduled by the operating system. <br/>

***Process*** <br/>
A process is a group of associated threads that execute in the same shared environment(memory space). It follows, then that a *single-thread process* is one 
that contains exactly one thread, whereas a *multi-thread process* supports more than one thread.
<br/>

&emsp;&emsp;
By *shared environment*, we mean that the threads in the same process share the same memory space and can communicate directly with 
one another. Refer to Figure 13.3 for an overview of threads and their shared environment within a process.

&emsp;&emsp;
By *shared memory* in Figure 13.1, we are generally referring to **static** variables as well as instance and local variables passed to a 
thread. Static methods and variables are defined on a single class object that all instances share. For example, if one thread updates 
the value of a static object, this information is immediately available for other threads within the process to read.
