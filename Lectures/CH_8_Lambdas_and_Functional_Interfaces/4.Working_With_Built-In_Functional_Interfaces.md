For the exam, you need to memorize Table 8.4. We will give you lots of practice in this section to help make it 
memorable. Before you ask, most of the time we don't assign the implementation of the interface to a variable. The 
interface name is implied, and it i passed directly to the method that needs it. We are introducing the names so 
that you can better understand and remember what is going on.
> __Note:__
> You learn about a few more functional interfaces later in the book. In the next chapter, we cover Comparator. 
> In Chapter 13, "Concurrency", we discuss Runnable and Callable. These may show up on the exam when you are asked 
> to recognize functional interfaces.

## I. Implementing Supplier
A supplier is used when you want to generate or supply values without taking any input. The Supplier interface is 
defined as follows:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Supplier<T> {
    T get();
}
```

```java
Supplier<LocalDate> s1 = LocalDate::now;
Supplier<LocalDate> s2 = () -> LocalDate.now();

LocalDate d1 = s1.get();
LocalDate d2 = s2.get();

System.out.println(d1);  //2024-05-31
System.out.println(d2);  //2024-05-31
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This example prints a data twice. It's also a good opportunity to review static method references. The 
LocalDate::now method reference is used to create a Supplier to assign to an intermediate s1. A Supplier is often used 
when constructing new objects. For example, we can print two empty StringBuilder objects:
```java
Supplier<StringBuilder> s1 = StringBuilder::new;
Supplier<StringBuilder> s2 = () -> new StringBuilder();

System.out.println(s1.get());   // Empty String
System.out.println(s2.get())    // Empty String
```

```java
Supplier<ArrayList<String>> s3 = ArrayList::new;
ArrayList<String> a1 = s3.get();
System.out.println(a1);       // []
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Notice how we called get() on the functional interface. What would happen if we tried ot print s3 itself?
```java
System.out.println(s3);
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The code prints somethinglike this:
```java
functionalinterface.BuiltIns$$Lambda$1/0x0000000800066840@4909b8da
```
&emsp;&emsp;
That's the result of calling toString() on a lambda.

## II. Implementing Consumer and BiConsumer
You use a Consumer when you __want to do something with a parameter but not return anything__. BiConsumer does the 
same thing, except that it takes two parameters. The interfaces are defined as follows:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Consumer<T> {
    void accept(T t);
}

@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiConsumer<T, U> {
    void accept(T t, U u);
}
```
> __Tip:__
> You'll notice this pattern, Bi means two. Always add another parameter when you see Bi.

Printing is a common use of the Consumer interface.
```java
Consumer<String> c1 = System.out::println;
Consumer<String> c2 = x -> System.out.println(x); 

c1.accept("Annie");     //Annie
c2.accept("Annie");     //Annie
```
&emsp;&emsp;
BiConsumer is called with two parameters. They don;t have to be the same type. For example, we can put a ey and a value 
in a map using this interface:
```java
var map = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
BiConsumer<String, Integer> b1 = map::put;
BiConsumer<String, Integer> b2 = (k, v) -> map.put(k, v);

b1.accept("chicken", 7);
b2.accpet("chick", 1);

System.out.println(map);    //{chicken=7, check=1}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
As another example, we use the same type for both generic parameters:
```java
var map = new HashMap<String, String>();
BiConsumer<String, String> b1 = map::put;
BiConsumer<String, String> b2 = (k, v) -> map.put(k, v);

b1.accept("chicken", "A");
b2.accpet("chick", "B");

System.out.println(map);    //{chicken=A, check=B}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This shows that a BiConsumer can use the same type for both the T and U generic parameters.

## III. Implementing Predicate and BiPredicate
Predicates is often used when __filtering or matching__. Both are common operations. A BiPredicate is just like a 
Predicate, except that it takes two parameters instead of one. The interfaces are defined as follows:
```java
@FunctionalIntrface
public interface Predicate<T> {
    boolean test(T t);
}

@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiPredicate<T, U> {
    boolean test(T t, U u);
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
You can use a Predicate when you want to evaluate a condition.
```java
Predicate<String> p1 = String::isEmpty;
Predicate<String> p2 = x -> x.IsEmpty();

System.out.println(p1.test(""));        // true
System.out.println(p2.test("asas"));    // false
```
BiPredicate example:
```java
BiPredicate<String, String> b1 = String:startsWith;
BiPredicate<String, String> b2 = (String, prefix) -> String.startsWith(prefix);

System.out.println(b1.test("Chicken", chick));      //true
System.out.println(b2.test("Chicken", chick));      //true
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The method reference includes both the instance variable and parameter for startsWith() method. This is a good 
example of how method references save quite a lot of typing. The downside is that they are less explicit, and you 
really have to understand what is going on!

## IV. Implementing Function and BiFunction
A Function is responsible for __turning one parameter into a value of a potentially different type and returning it__. 
Similarly, a BiFunction is responsible for tuning two parameters into a value and returning it. The interface are 
defined as follows:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Function<T, R> {
    R apply(T t);
}

public interface Function<T, U, R> {
    R apply(T t, U u);
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
For example, this function converts a String to the length of the String:
```java
Function<String, Integer> f1 = String::length;
Function<String, Integer> f2 = x -> x.length();

System.out.println(f1.apply("Test"));           // 4
System.out.println(f2.apply("Hola Mundo"));     // 10
```
The following combines two String objects and produces another String::
```java
BiFunction<String, String, String> b1 = String::concat;
BiFunction<String, String, String> b2 = (string, toAdd) -> string.concat(toAdd);

System.out.println(b1.apply("hola ", "mundo"));     // hola mundo
System.out.println(b2.apply("harry ", "potter"));   // harry potter
```
## V. Implementing Unary Operator and BinaryOperator
UnaryOperator and BinaryOperator are special cases of a Function. They require __all type parameters to be the same 
type__. A UnaryOperator __transforms its value into one of the same type__. For example, incrementing by one is a unary 
operation. In fact, UnaryOperator extends Function. A BinaryOperator merges two values into one of the same type. 
Adding two numbers is a binary operation. Similarly, BinaryOperator extends BiFunction. The interfaces are defined 
as follows:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface UnaryOperator<T> extends Function<T, T> {
    
}

@FunctionalInterface
public interface BinaryOperator<T> extends BiFunction<T, T, T> {
    
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This means the method signatures look like this:
```java
T apply(T, t);          //UnaryOperator
T apply(T t1, T t2);    //BiOperator
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The generic declarations on the subclasses are what force the type to be the same. For the unary example, notice 
how the return type is the same as the parameter.
```java
UnaryOperator<String> u1 = String::toUpperCase;
UnaryOperator<String> u2 = x -> x.toUppercase();

System.out.printnln(u1.apply("hello"));         //HELLO
System.out.println(u2.apply("world"));          //WORLD
```

&emsp;&emsp;
We don't need to specify the return type in the generics because UnaryOperator requires it to be the same as the
parameter. And now here's the binary example:
```java
BinaryOperator<String> b1 = String::concat;
BinaryOperator<String> b2 = (string, toAdd) -> string.concat(toAdd);

System.out.println(b1.apply("Ariel ", "Quiroz"));       // Ariel Quiroz
System.out.println(b2.apply("Gael ", "Julian"));        // Gael Julian
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Notice that this does the same thing as the BiFunction example. The code is more succinct, which shows the importance 
of using the best functional interface. It's nice to have one generic type specified instead of three.

## VI. Checking Functional Interfaces
It's really important to know the number of parameters, types, return value, and method name for each of the 
functional interfaces. Now would be a good time to memorize Table 8.4 if you haven't done so already. Let's do 
some examples to practice.

&emsp;&emsp;
What functional interface would you use in these three situations?
- Returns a String without taking any parameters (Supplier)
- Returns a Boolean and takes a String (Function<String, Boolean>)
- Returns an Integer and takes two Integer 

&emsp;&emsp;
If you think that the second is a predicate you are wrong. Note that a Predicate returns a boolean primitive and not a 
Boolean object.
The third one is either a BinaryOperator or BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer>. Since BinaryOperator is a special 
case of BiFunction, either is a correct answer. BinaryOperator is the better answer of the two since it is 
more specific.

&emsp;&emsp;
What functional interface would you use to fill in the blanks for these?
```java
6: ______ <List> ex1 = x -> "".equals(x.get(0));
7: ______ <Long> ex2 = (Long l) -> System.out.println(l);
8: ______ <String, String> ex3 = (s1, s2) -> false;
```
Line 6 is a Predicate or Function.
Line 7 is a Consumer.
Line 9 is a BiPredicate

&emsp;&emsp;
Where is the error?
```java
6: Function<List<String>> ex1 = x -> x.get(0);      // DOES NOT COMPILE
7: UnaryOperator<Long> ex2 = (Long l) -> 3.14;      // DOES NOT COMPILE
```
The return type missing in the line 6, causing the code not compile. 
Line 7 is a UnaryOperator, which returns the same type as it is passed in. The example returns a double than a Long, 
causing the code not to compile.

## VI. Using Convenience Methods on Functional Interfaces
---------------------------------------------------------
Several functional interfaces have a number of helpful __default interface methods__.
&emsp;&emsp;
Table 8.5 shows the convenience methods on the built-in functional interfaces that you need to know for the exam. All of 
these facilitate modifying or combining functional interfaces of the same type. Note that Table 8.5 shows only the main 
interfaces. The BiConsumer, BiFunction, and BiPredicate interfaces have similar methods available.

> __Table 8.5__: Convenience methods

| Interface instance | Method return type | Method name | Method parameters |
|:-------------------|:-------------------|:------------|:------------------|
| Consumer           | Consumer           | andThen()   | Consumer          |
| Function           | Function           | andThen()   | Function          |
| Function           | Function           | compose()   | Function          |
| Predicate          | Predicate          | and()       | Predicate         |
| Predicate          | Predicate          | negate()    | ---               |
| Predicate          | Predicate          | or()        | Predicate         |


&emsp;&emsp;
Let's start with these two Predicate variables:
```java
Predicate<String> egg = s -> s.conatins("egg");
Predicate<String> brown = s -> s.conatins("brown");
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Now we want a Predicate for brown eggs and another for all other colors of eggs. We could write this by hand, as 
shown here:
```java
Predicate<String> brownEggs = s -> s .contains("egg") && s.conatins("brown");
Predicate<String> otherEggs = s -> s .contains("egg") && !s.conatins("brown");
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This works, but it’s not great. It’s a bit long to read, and it contains duplication. What if we decide the letter e 
should be capitalized in egg? We’d have to change it in three variables: egg, brownEggs, and otherEggs. A better way to 
deal with this situation is to use two of the default methods on Predicate.

```java
Predicate<String> brownEggs = egg.and(brown);
Predicate<String> otherEggs = egg.and(brown.negate());
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Great! Now we are reusing the logic in the original Predicate variables to build two new ones. It’s shorter and clearer 
what the relationship is between variables. We can also change the spelling of egg in one place, and the other two 
objects will have new logic because they reference it.

&emsp;&emsp;
Moving on to Consumer, let’s take a look at the andThen() method, which runs two functional interfaces in sequence:

```java
Consumer<String> c1 = x -> System.out.println("1: " + x);
Consumer<String> c2 = x -> System.out.println(",2: " + x);

Consumer<String> combined = c1.andThen(c2);
combined.accept("Annie");               // 1: Annie,2: Annie
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Notice how the same parameter is passed to both c1 and c2. This shows that the Consumer instances are run in sequence 
and are independent of each other. By contrast, the compose() method on Function chains functional interfaces. However, 
it passes along the output of one to the input of another.

```java
Function<Integer, Integer> before = x -> x + 1;
Function<Integer, Integer> after = x -> x * 2;

Function<Integer, Integer> combined = after.compose(before);
System.out.println(combined.apply(3));          // 8
```
## VIII. Learning the Functional Interfaces for Primitives
----------------------------------------------------------
There are also a large number of special functional interfaces for primitives. These are useful in Chapter 10 when we 
cover streams and optionals.

&emsp;&emsp;
Most of them are for the double, int, and long types. There is one exception, which is BooleanSupplier. We cover 
that before introducing the functional interfaces  for double, int, and long.

### 1. Functional Interfaces for boolean
BooleanSupplier is a separate type. It has one method to implement.
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BooleanInterface {
    boolean getAsBoolean();
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
It works just as you have come to expect from functional interfaces. Here's an example:
```java
BooleanSupplier b1 = () -> false;
BooleanSupplier b2 = () -> Math.random() > 4;
Systsm.out.println(b1.getAsBoolean());      //false
System.out.println(b2.getAsBoolean());      //false
```

### 2. Functional Interfaces for double, int and long.
> __Table 8.6__: Common functional interfaces for primitives

| Functional interfaces | Return type | Single abstract method | # of parameters    |
|:----------------------|:------------|:-----------------------|:-------------------|
| DoubleSupplier        | double      | getAsDouble()          | 0                  |
| IntSupplier           | int         | getAsInt()             | 0                  |

| LongPredicate         | boolean     | test                   | 1 (long)           |
| DoubleFunction        | R           | apply                  | 1 (double)         |
| IntFunction           | R           | apply                  | 1 (int)            |
| LongFunction          | R           | apply                  | 1 (long)           |
| DoubleUnaryOperator   | double      | applyAsDouble          | 1 (double)         |
| IntUnaryOperator      | int         | applyAsInt             | 1 (int)            |
| LongUnaryOperator     | long        | applyAsLong            | 1 (long)           |
| DoubleBinaryOperator  | double      | applyAsDouble          | 2 (double, double) |
| IntBinaryOperator     | int         | applyAsInt             | 2 (int, int)       |
| LongBinaryOperator    | long        | applyAsLong            | 2 (long, long)     |

&emsp;&emsp;
In addition to Table 8.4 equivalents, some interfaces are specific to primitives. Table 8.7 lists these.
> __Table 8.7__ Primitive-specific functional interfaces

| Functional interfaces    | Return type | Single abstract method | # of parameters |
|:-------------------------|:------------|:-----------------------|:----------------|

&emsp;&emsp;
Which functional interface would you use to fill in the blank to make the following code compile?

```java
var d = 1.0;
_________ f1 = x -> 1;
f1.applyAsInt(d);
```
&emsp;&emsp;
When you see a question like this, look for clues. You can see that the functional interface in question takes a double 
parameter and returns an int. You can also see that it has a single abstract method named applyAsInt. The 
DoubleToIntFunction and ToIntFunction functional interfaces meet all three of those criteria.

## Questions
1. What is the output of the following application?
```java
package zoo;
import java.util.function.*;

public class TickerTaker {
    private static int AT_CAPACITY = 100;
    
    public int takeTicket(int currentCount, IntUnaryOperator<Integer counter>) {
        return counter.applyAsInt(currentCount);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final TicketTaker bob = new TickerTaker();
        final int oldCount = 50;
        final int newCount = bob.takeTicket(oldCount, t -> {
            if(t > AT_CAPACITY) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Sorry, max has been reached");
            }
            return t + 1;
        });
        System.out.print(newCount);
    }
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
_Answer_ <br/>
The code does not compile for different reason. <br/>
The IntUnaryOperator functional interface is not generic, so the argument `IntUnaryOperator<Integer>` in the 
`takeTicket*()` does not compile.
2. Which of the following three functional interfaces is not equivalent to the other two?
A. `Bifunction<Double, Double, Double>` <br/>
B. `BinaryOperator<Double>` <br/>
C. `DoubleFunction<Double>` <br/>
D. None of the above. All three are equivalent <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;
_Answer_ <br/>
C. Options A and B take two `Double` input arguments and return a `Double` value, making them equivalent to each other. 
On the other hand, option  takes a single double value and returns a Double value. For this reason, it is a different 
from the other two, making option C correct. <br/>
3. What standard functional interface returns a primitive type? <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;
_Answer_ <br/>
ToDoubleFunction <br/>
It returns a double. There are several versions of ToXXXFunction. They are primitive returning versions of Function. For 
example, ToIntFunction return an int.
