# Working with Advanced Stream pipeline Concepts
## I. Linking Streams to the Underlying Data
What do you think outputs?
```java
25: var cats = new ArrayList<>();
26: cats.add("Annie");
27: cats.add("Garfield");
28: var stream = cats.stream();
29: cats.add("KC");
30: System.out.println(stream.count());         //3
```
Remember streams are lazily evaluated. This means that the stream isn't created on line 28. An object is created that 
knows where to look for the data when it is needed. On line 29, the List gets a new element. On line 30, the stream 
pipeline runs. First, it looks at the source and seeing three elements.

## II. Chaining Optionals
```java
private static void threeDigit(Optional<Integer> optional) {
    optional.map(n -> "" + n)
            .filter(s -> s.length() == 3)
            .ifPresent(System.out::println);
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Now suppose that we wanted to get an `Optional<Integer>` representing the length of the String contained in another 
Optional. Easy enough:
```java
Optional<Integer> result = optional.map(String::length);
```
## III. Using a Spliterator
A spliterator provides thi level of control over processing. It starts wiht a Collection or a stream--that is your bag
of food. You call `trySplit()` to take some food out of the bag. The rest of the food stays in the original 
Spliterator object.
&emsp;&emsp;
The characteristics of a Spliterator depend on the underlying data source. A Collection data source is basic Spliterator. 
By contrast, when using a Stream data source, the Spliterator can be parallel or even infinite. The Stream itself is 
executed lazily rather than when the Spliterator i created.
&emsp;&emsp;
The simplified methods you need to know are in the table 10.9.
> __Table 10.9:__ Spliterator methods

| Method                            | Description                                                                                                             |
|:----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spliterator trySplit()            | Returns Spliterator containing ideally half of the data, which is removed from current  <br/>                           |
|                                   | Spliterator. This method can be called multiple times an will eventually return null when data is no linger splittable. |
| void forEachRemaining(Consumer c) | Precesses remaining elements in Spliterator                                                                             |
| boolean tryAdvance(Consumer c)    | Process single element from Spliterator if ay remain. Returns whether element was processed.                            |
