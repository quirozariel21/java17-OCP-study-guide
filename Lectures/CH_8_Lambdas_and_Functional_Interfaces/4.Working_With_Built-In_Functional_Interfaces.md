For the exam, you need to memorize Table 8.4. We will give you lots of practice in this section to help make it 
memorable. Before you ask, most of the time we don't assign the implementation of the interface to a variable. The 
interface name is implied, and it i passed directly to the method that needs it. We are introducing the names so 
that you can better understand and remember what is going on.
> __Note:__
> You learn about a few more functional interfaces later in the book. In the next chapter, we cover Comparator. 
> In Chapter 13, "Concurrency", we discuss Runnable and Callable. These may show up on the exam when you are asked 
> to recognize functional interfaces.

## I. Implementing Supplier
A supplier is used when you want to generate or supply values without taking any input. The Supplier interface is 
defined as follows:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Supplier<T> {
    T get();
}
```

```java
Supplier<LocalDate> s1 = LocalDate::now;
Supplier<LocalDate> s2 = () -> LocalDate.now();

LocalDate d1 = s1.get();
LocalDate d2 = s2.get();

System.out.println(d1);  //2024-05-31
System.out.println(d2);  //2024-05-31
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This example prints a data twice. It's also a good opportunity to review static method references. The 
LocalDate::now method reference is used to create a Supplier to assign to an intermediate s1. A Supplier is often used 
when constructing new objects. For example, we can print two empty StringBuilder objects:
```java
Supplier<StringBuilder> s1 = StringBuilder::new;
Supplier<StringBuilder> s2 = () -> new StringBuilder();

System.out.println(s1.get());   // Empty String
System.out.println(s2.get())    // Empty String
```

```java
Supplier<ArrayList<String>> s3 = ArrayList::new;
ArrayList<String> a1 = s3.get();
System.out.println(a1);       // []
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Notice how we called get() on the functional interface. What would happen if we tried ot print s3 itself?
```java
System.out.println(s3);
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The code prints somethinglike this:
```java
functionalinterface.BuiltIns$$Lambda$1/0x0000000800066840@4909b8da
```
&emsp;&emsp;
That's the result of calling toString() on a lambda.

## II. Implementing Consumer an BiConsumer
You use a Consumer when you want to do something with a parameter but not return anything. BiConsumer does the 
same thing, except that it takes two parameters. The interfaces are defined as follows:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Consumer<T> {
    void accept(T t);
}

@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiConsumer<T, U> {
    void accept(T t, U u);
}
```
> __Tip:__
> You'll notice this pattern, Bi means two. Always add another parameter when you see Bi.

Printing is a common use of the Consumer interface.
```java
Consumer<String> c1 = System.out::println;
Consumer<String> c2 = x -> System.out.println(x); 

c1.accept("Annie");     //Annie
c2.accept("Annie");     //Annie
```
&emsp;&emsp;
BiConsumer is called with two parameters. They don;t have to be the same type. For example, we can put a ey and a value 
in a map using this interface:
```java
var map = new HashNapM<String, Integer>();
BiConsumer<String, Integer> b1 = map::put;
BiConsumer<String, Integer> b2 = (k, v) -> map.put(k, v);

b1.accept("chicken", 7);
b2.accpet("chick", 1);

System.out.println(map);    //{chicken=7, check=1}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
As another example, we use the same type for both generic parameters:
```java
var map = new HashMap<String, String>();
BiConsumer<String, String> b1 = map::put;
BiConsumer<String, String> b2 = (k, v) -> map.put(k, v);

b1.accept("chicken", "A");
b2.accpet("chick", "B");

System.out.println(map);    //{chicken=A, check=B}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This shows that a BiConsumer can use the same type for both the T and U generic parameters.

## III. Implementing Predicate and BiPredicate
Predicates is often used when __filtering or matching__. Both are common operations. A BiPredicate is just like a 
Predicate, except that it takes two parameters instead of one. The interfaces are defined as follows:
```java
@FunctionalIntrface
public interface Predicate<T> {
    boolean test(T t);
}

@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiPredicate<T, U> {
    boolean test(T t, U u);
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
You can use a Predicate when you want to evaluate a condition.
```java
Predicate<String> p1 = String::isEmpty;
Predicate<String> p2 = x -> x.IsEmpty();

System.out.println(p1.test(""));        // true
System.out.println(p2.test("asas"));    // false
```
BiPredicate example:
```java
BiPredicate<String, String> b1 = String:startsWith;
BiPredicate<String, String> b2 = (String, prefix) -> String.startsWith(prefix);

System.out.println(b1.test("Chicken", chick));      //true
System.out.println(b2.test("Chicken", chick));      //true
```
&emsp;&emsp;
The method reference includes both the instance variable and parameter for startsWith() method. This is a good 
example of how method references save quite a lot of typing. The downside is that they are less explicit, and you 
really have to understand what is going on!

## IV. Implementing Function and BiFunction
A Function is responsible for __turning one parameter into a value of a potentially different type and returning it__. 
Similarly, a BiFunction is responsible for tuning two parameters into a value and returning it. The interface are 
defined as follows:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Function<T, R> {
    R apply(T t);
}

public interface Function<T, U, R> {
    R apply(T t, U u);
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
For example, this function converts a String to the length of the String:
```java
Function<String, Integer> f1 = String::length;
Function<String, Integer> f2 = x -> x.length();

System.out.println(f1.apply("Test"));           // 4
System.out.println(f2.apply("Hola Mundo"));     // 10
```
The following combines two String objects and produces another String::
```java
BiFunction<String, String, String> b1 = String::concat;
BiFunction<String, String, String> b2 = (string, toAdd) -> string.concat(toAdd);

System.out.println(b1.apply("hola ", "mundo"));     // hola mundo
System.out.println(b2.apply("harry ", "potter"));   // harry potter
```
## V. Implementing Unary Operator and BinaryOperator
UnaryOperator and BinaryOperator are special cases of a Function. They require __all type parameters to be the same 
type__. A UnaryOperator __transforms its value into one of the same type__. For example, incrementing by one is a unary 
operation. In fact, UnaryOperator extends Function. A BinaryOperator merges two values into one of the same type. 
Adding two numbers is a binary operation. Similarly, BinaryOperator extends BiFunction. The interfaces are defined 
as follows:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface UnaryOperator<T> extends Function<T, T> {
    
}

@FunctionalInterface
public interface BinaryOperator<T> extends BiFunction<T, T, T> {
    
}
```
&emsp;&emsp;
This means the method signatures look like this:
```java
T apply(T, t);          //UnaryOperator
T apply(T t1, T t2);    //BiOperator
```

&emsp;&emsp;
The generic declarations on the subclasses are what force the type to be the same. For the unary example, notice 
how the return type is the same as the parameter.
```java
UnaryOperator<String> u1 = String;;toUpperCase;
UnaryOperator<String> u2 = x -> x.toUppercase();

System.out.printnln(u1.apply("hello"));         //HELLO
System.out.println(u2.apply("world"));          //WORLD
```

&emsp;&emsp;
We don't need to specify the return type in the generics because UnaryOperator requires it to be the same as the
parameter. And now here's the binary example:
```java
BinaryOperator<String> b1 = String::concat;
BinaryOperator<String> b2 = (string, toAdd) -> string.concat(toAdd);

System.out.println(b1.apply("Ariel ", "Quiroz"));       // Ariel Quiroz
System.out.println(b2.apply("Gael ", "Julian"));        // Gael Julian
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Notice that this does the same thing as the BiFunction example. The code is more succinct, which shows the importance 
of using the best functional interface. It's nice to have one generic type specified instead of three.
