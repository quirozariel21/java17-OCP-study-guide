# Creating Threads with the Concurrency API

**Table 13.1** Executor Service methods

| Method name                                                        | Description |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| void execute(Runnable command)                                     | Executes Runnable task at some point in future | 
| Future<?> submit(Runnable task)                                    | Executes Runnable task at some point in future and returns Future representing task |
| Future submit(Callable task)                                       | Executes Callable task at some point in future and returns Future representing <br/> pending results of task |
| List<Future> invokeAll(Collection<?<<br/> extends Callable> tasks) | |
| T invokeAny(Collection<? extends <br/>>Callable tasks)             | |

> **Submitting Tasks: *execute() vs submit()***
> As you might have notices, the `execute()` and `submit()` methods are nearly identical when applied to Runnable expressions. The 
> `submit()` method has the obvious advantage of doing the same thing `execute()` does, but with a return object that can be used to 
> track the result. Because of this advantage and fact that `execute()` does not support **Callable** expressions, we tend to prefer 
> `submit()` over `execute()`, even if we don't store the Future reference.

`ExecutorService's` has th following three overloaded submit methods:
- `Future<?> submit(Runnable task)`
   Submits a Runnable task for execution and return a Future representing that task.
- `<T> Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result)`
  Submits a Runnable task for execution and return a Future representing that task.
- `<T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task)`
Submits a value-returning task for execution and returns a Future representing th pending results of the task.
