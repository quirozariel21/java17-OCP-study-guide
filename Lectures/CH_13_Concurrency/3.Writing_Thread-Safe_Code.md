| Sr. <br/> No. | Key                  | ReentrantLock                                                                                            | Synchronized                                        |

|       1       | Acquire Lock         | Provides `lock()` methods to acquire <br> a lock on shared resource by a thread.                         | Acquire lock by writing the `synchronized` keyword. |
|       2       | Release Lock         | Requires explicit call to `unlock()` method.                                                             | Released implicitly.                                |
|       3       | ability to Interrupt | `lockInterruptibility()` method allows <br/> interrupting the thread.                                    | No direct way to interrupt the thread               |
|       4       | Fairness             | Constructor has fairness parameter; if true, favors <br/> granting access to the longest-waiting thread. | no guarantee of any particular access order         |
|       5       | Lock Release Order   | Locks can be released in any order                                                                       | Locks must be released in the same order acquired.  |
