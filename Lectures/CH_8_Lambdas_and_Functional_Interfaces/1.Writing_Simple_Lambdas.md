# Writing Simple Lambdas
------------------------
Functional programming is a way of writing code more declarative. You focus more on expressions than loops.
&emsp;&emsp;
Functional programming uses lambda expressions to write code. Lambda expressions are often referred to as lambdas 
for short.

## I. Looking at a Lambda Example:
Our goal is to print out all the animals ina list according to some criteria.
```java
public record Animal(String species, boolean canHop, boolean canSwim) {}
```

```java
public interface CheckTrait {
    boolean test(Animal a);
}
```

```java
public class CheckIfHopper implements CheckTrait {
    @Override
    boolean test(Animal a) {
        return a.canHop();
    }
}
```

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TraditionalSearch {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        var animals = new ArrayList<Animal>();
        animals.add(new Animal("fish", false, true));
        animals.add(new Animal("kangaroo", true, false));
        animals.add(new Animal("rabbit", true, false));
        animals.add(new Animal("turtle", false, true));
        
        print(animals, new CheckIfHopper());
    }
    
    private static print(List<Animal> animals, CheckTrait checker) {
        for(Animal animal: animals) {
            if(checker.test(animal)) {
                System.out.println(animal + " ");
            }
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

&emsp;&emsp;
What happens if we want to print the Animals that swim?. we need to write another class, CheckIfSwims. Granted, it is 
only a few lines, but it is a new file.

&emsp;&emsp;
Why can't we specify the logic we care about right here? It turns out that we can, with lambda expressions.
```java
    print(animals, a -> a.canHop());
```

```java
    print(animals, a -> a.canSwim());
```

```java
    print(animals, a -> !a.canSwim());
```

## II. Learning Lambda Syntax
One of the simplest lambda expressions you can write id the one you just saw:
```java
a -> a.canHop()
```

&emsp;&emsp;
Lambdas works with interfaces that have exactly one abstract method.

&emsp;&emsp;
The syntax of lambdas is tricky because many parts are optional. These two lines do the exact same thing:
```java
a -> a.canHop()
(Animal a) -> { return a.canHop(); }
```
&emsp;&emsp;
Another valid syntax:
```java
    a -> { return a.canHop(); }
    (Animal a) -> a.canHop()
```

> __Note__
> Here's a fun fact: s -> {} is a valid lambda. There is no code on the right side of the expression, you don't need 
> the semicolon or return statement.

> __Table__ Valid lambdas that return a boolean

| Lambda                                  | # of parameters  |
| :---------------------------------------| :---------------:|
| x -> true                               |   0              |
| x -> x.startsWith("test")               |   1              |
| (x, y) -> { return x.startsWith(y); }   |   2              |
| (String x, String y) -> x.startsWith(y) |   2              |

> __Table__ Invalid lambdas that return a boolean

| Lambda                          |             Reason              |
|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------:|
| x,y -> x.startsWith("test")     |   Missing parentheses on left   |
| x -> { x.startsWith("test") }   |     Missing return on right     |
| x -> { return x.startsWith(y) } | Missing semicolon inside braces |
| String x -> x.startsWith(y)     |   Missing parentheses on left   |

&emsp;&emsp;
Remember that the ___parentheses are optional___ only when there is one parameter  and it doesn't have a type declared. 
Those are the basics of writing a lambda.
